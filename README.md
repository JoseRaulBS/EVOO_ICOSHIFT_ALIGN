The ICOSHIFT package was utilized for spectral alignment to improve data quality and reliability for subsequent multivariate analysis. Unlike traditional methods that align spectra to a single reference signal, this approach corrects local misalignments by dividing the spectrum into intervals, addressing sample-dependent peak shifts due to chemical variations, solvent interactions, or experimental conditions.
